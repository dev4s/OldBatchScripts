# (~2010) Old batch files

This repository contains some old batch (*.bat) files I was using when working with (mostly) Joomla stuff.

Descriptions:
* **Disable JS Debugging.bat** - it disables Java Script debugging in Visual Studio 2008 when not working in IE ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/830497/how-do-i-shut-off-visual-studio-2008-script-debugging))
* **Enable JS Debugging.bat** - as above, but enables it
* **IISExpressKiller.bat** - it "kills" all instances of IISExpress
* **Start Services.bat** - starts needed services (IIS, WAS, Xampp)
* **Stop Services.bat** - as above, stops them
* **Joomla Helper Scripts/*** - those scripts allowed me an automatic and quick install of Joomla (I wasn't loosing time installing and configuring it :))
